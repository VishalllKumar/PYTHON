#Typecasting in Python : The conversion of one data typ into the other data type is known as type casting in python
# a = '1'
# b = '2'
# print(a + b)#output : 12, because input of a and b is string  type
# a = 1
# b = 2
# print(a + b)#output : 3, because input of a and b is integer type
#Explicit TypeCasting:
# a = '1'
# b = '2'
# print( int(a) + int(b) ) # converts string input to integer
#Implicit TypeCasting:
# a = 1.9
# b = 8
# print(a + b)# agar ek input float hoga aur dusra integer to output float me hi ayega to prevent data loss.
